#### Answer the question below by updating this file.

Q: The management requested a new feature where in the fictional e-commerce app must have a "featured products" section.
How would you go about implementing this feature in the backend?

A: Two methods can be used to implement this new functionality. The first approach is to include a "featured" column with a boolean data type. This will determine whether the product is featured or not and accept true or false values. The second is designating the most sold products as featured, which may be done by using an existing table such as "orders" and calculating the overall amount of sales.
